## Overview

Chief-Of-State is a **_gRPC distributed event sourcing_** application that provides scalable, configurable, events and state management strategies to relieve this responsibility from the developers.

Chief-Of-State is language agnostic, which means that services can be written in any language that supports gRPC.

Chief-Of-State can be bundled as a sidecar to the application it is providing events and state management or run it on its own k8 pod.

Chief-Of-State heavily relies on the robustness of [lagom-pb](https://github.com/super-flat/lagom-pb).

## Features

- Journal and Snapshot serialization using google protocol buffer message format.

- Out of the box clustering and powerful events and domain entities sharding with split-brain-resolver algorithm.

- Out of the box entities passivation mechanism to free resources whenever necessary.

- All events, state serialization using google protocol buffer message format and persisted to postgres.

- Additional meta data are provided to your events via the `MetaData`.

- Commands and Events handlers via gRPC.

- Read Side processor via gRPC (every persisted event is available when the read side is turn on).

- Out of the box Read Side offset management residing in the Chief-Of-State readSide store (postgresql).

- Out of the box observability.

- Out of the box configurable k8 deployment.

### Local dev

- For local development, the following pre-requisites are necessary:
    - Install at least Java 8 [Java download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) on your local dev machine.

    - [Sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) must be installed on the development machine.

    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)  must be installed on the development machine.

    - Set the [global](#global-environment-variables) in addition with the [local](#local-dev-options) ones. Check a sample docker-compose file inside the docker folder.

    - Run `sbt dockerComposeUp` to start the application

    - Run `sbt dockerComposeStop` to gracefully stop the application

### Inside a _docker-compose_ file

- Pull the docker image from `registry.namely.land/namely/chief-of-state:<tag>` where `tag` is the latest release tag.

- Set the environment variable listed [here](#global-environment-variables) in addition with the [local](#local-dev-options) ones.

- Set the following environment variable `JAVA_OPTS: "-Dconfig.resource=docker.conf"`

- Happy hacking :)

### Read side configurations

- SETTING_NAME - Supported setting names:
  - HOST - Read side host
  - PORT - Read side port
- READSIDE_ID - Unique id for the read side instance

| environment variable | description | default |
|--- | --- | --- |
| COS_READ_SIDE_CONFIG_<SETTING_NAME>_<READSIDE_ID> | readside configuration settings | <none> |

### Local dev options

| environment variable | description | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COS_DOCKER_SERVICE_NAME | name of chief of state in your docker compose | chiefofstate |
| COS_DOCKER_REPLICA_COUNT | wait for this many replicas before starting (not recommended to change) | 1 |

### Production k8s options

| environment variable | description | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POD_IP | IP of the pod running chief of state (see note below) | <none> |
| COS_KUBERNETES_APP_LABEL | k8s metadata app label (must match exactly) that lagom uses when bootstrapping the cluster to discover its peers | <none> |
| COS_KUBERNETES_REPLICA_COUNT | must match the replica count on your deployment | 1 |

#### Kubernetes deployment

- Pod IP should be dynamic with a k8s enviornment setting, such as:

```yaml
env:
  - name: POD_IP
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        apiVersion: v1
        fieldPath: status.podIP
```

- K8s configuration for tracing agent at Namely

```yaml
- name: NODE_NAME
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: spec.nodeName
- name: TRACE_HOST
  value: $(NODE_NAME)
- name: TRACE_PORT
  value: "9080"
```

### Sample Projects

- [.NET Core](https://github.com/namely/cos-banking)
- [Golang](https://github.com/namely/cos-go-sample)
- [Python](https://github.com/namely/cos-python-sample)

### Notes

todo:

- think about scaling out replicas in k8s (don't want to break the k8s replica)
- add more read_side_config settings
