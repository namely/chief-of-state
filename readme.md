## Chief of State

[![Build Status](https://drone.namely.land/api/badges/namely/chief-of-state/status.svg)](https://drone.namely.land/namely/chief-of-state)

gRPC distributed event sourcing

###Notes

todo:

- think about scaling out replicas in k8s (don't want to break the k8s replica)
- kafka configs

### Local dev options

| key | description | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COS_DOCKER_SERVICE_NAME | name of chief of state in your docker compose | chiefofstate |
| COS_DOCKER_REPLICA_COUNT | wait for this many replicas before starting (not recommended to change) | 1 |

### Production k8s options

| key | description | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POD_IP | IP of the pod running chief of state (see note below) | <none> |
| COS_KUBERNETES_APP_LABEL | k8s metadata app label (must match exactly) that lagom uses when bootstrapping the cluster to discover its peers | <none> |
| COS_KUBERNETES_REPLICA_COUNT | must match the replica count on your deployment | 1 |

#### Kubernetes deployment

- Pod IP should be dynamic with a k8s enviornment setting, such as:

```yaml
env:
  - name: POD_IP
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        apiVersion: v1
        fieldPath: status.podIP
```

- K8s configuration for tracing agent at Namely

```yaml
- name: NODE_NAME
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: spec.nodeName
- name: TRACE_HOST
  value: $(NODE_NAME)
- name: TRACE_PORT
  value: "9080"
```
