## Overview

Chief-Of-State is a **_gRPC distributed event sourcing_** application that provides scalable, configurable, events and state management strategies to relieve this responsibility from the developers. 

Chief-Of-State is language agnostic, which means that services can be written in any language that supports gRPC. 

Chief-Of-State can be bundled as a sidecar to the application it is providing events and state management or run it on its own k8 pod. 

Chief-Of-State heavily relies on the robustness of [lagom-common](https://github.com/namely/lagom-common). 

## Features

- Journal, Snapshot are serialized using google protocol buffer message format
- All events, state and commands are defined using google protocol buffer message format
- Additional meta data are provided to your events via the `EventMeta`.
- Out of the box observability.
- Out of the box configurable k8 deployment

### Notes

todo:

- think about scaling out replicas in k8s (don't want to break the k8s replica)
- kafka configs

### Local dev options

| environment variable | description | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COS_DOCKER_SERVICE_NAME | name of chief of state in your docker compose | chiefofstate |
| COS_DOCKER_REPLICA_COUNT | wait for this many replicas before starting (not recommended to change) | 1 |

### Production k8s options

| environment variable | description | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POD_IP | IP of the pod running chief of state (see note below) | <none> |
| COS_KUBERNETES_APP_LABEL | k8s metadata app label (must match exactly) that lagom uses when bootstrapping the cluster to discover its peers | <none> |
| COS_KUBERNETES_REPLICA_COUNT | must match the replica count on your deployment | 1 |

#### Kubernetes deployment

- Pod IP should be dynamic with a k8s enviornment setting, such as:

```yaml
env:
  - name: POD_IP
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        apiVersion: v1
        fieldPath: status.podIP
```

- K8s configuration for tracing agent at Namely

```yaml
- name: NODE_NAME
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: spec.nodeName
- name: TRACE_HOST
  value: $(NODE_NAME)
- name: TRACE_PORT
  value: "9080"
```
