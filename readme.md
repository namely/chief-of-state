## Overview

Chief-of-state (COS) is a dockerized persistence framework for building modern, clustered, reactive applications.
COS encourages best practices in CQRS and event-sourcing through simple, language-agnostic interfaces via gRPC, and it
allows developers to describe their schema with Protobuf. Under the hood, COS leverages Akka to scale out and guarantee
performant, reliable persistence.

Chief-of-state was built by Namely with the following principles:
* Wire format should be the same as persistence (Protobuf is a better schema definition than DDL)
* Prototypes should scale
* Developers should never face race conditions or database locks
* A perfect datastore would offer random access by key, streaming semantics, and atomic writes
* Interfaces are better than rules

## Anatomy of a chief-of-state app

Developers implement two gRPC interfaces: a write handler for building state and, optionally, many read handlers for reacting to state changes.

### Write Handler

Developers describe state mutations by implementing two RPCâ€™s in the WriteSideHandlerService:
- `HandleCommand` accepts a command and the prior state of an entity and returns an Event. For example, given a command to UpdateUserEmail and a User, this RPC might return UserEmailUpdated.
- `HandleEvent` accepts an event and the prior state of an entity and returns a new state. For example, given a UserEmailUpdated event and a User, this RPC would return a new User instance with the email updated.

### Read Handler

In response to state mutations, COS is able to send changes to many ReadSideHandlerService implementations, which may take any action. COS guarantees at-least-once delivery of events and resulting state to each read side in the order they were persisted.

Some potential read side handlers might:
- Write state changes to a special data store like elastic
- Publish changes to kafka topics
- Send notifications to users in response to specific events

## Features
  - Journal and Snapshot serialization using google protocol buffer message format
  - Preconfigured Akka clustering and and domain entity sharding with the split-brain-resolver algorithm
  - Automatic caching and entity passivation
  - Automatic configuration of postgres storage on boot
  - Opentelemetry integration for tracing and prometheus metrics
  - Direct integration to Kubernetes to form a cluster

### Documentation

The following docs are available:

  - [Configuration options](./docs/configuration.md)
  - [Docker Deployment](./docs/docker-deployment.md)
  - [Kubernetes Deployment](./docs/kubernetes-deployment.md)

### Locally build / test

```bash
# install earth cli
brew install earthly

# locally build the image
earth +docker-build

# run local cluster with docker/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up -d

# observe containers
docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . ps

# shut it down
docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml down -t 0 --remove-orphans
```
