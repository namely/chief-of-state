## Overview

![Architecture Diagram](img/architecture.png?raw=true "Title")

Chief-Of-State is a **_gRPC distributed event sourcing_** application that provides scalable, configurable, events and
state management strategies to relieve this responsibility from the developers.

Chief-Of-State is language agnostic, which means that services can be written in any language that supports gRPC.

Chief-Of-State can be bundled as a sidecar to the application it is providing events and state management or run it on
its own k8 pod.

## Features

  - Journal and Snapshot serialization using google protocol buffer message format.
  - Out of the box clustering and powerful events and domain entities sharding with split-brain-resolver algorithm.
  - Out of the box entities passivation mechanism to free resources whenever necessary.
  - All events, state serialization using google protocol buffer message format and persisted to postgres.
  - Additional meta data are provided to your events via the `MetaData`.
  - Commands and Events handlers via gRPC.
  - Read Side processor via gRPC (every persisted event is available when the read side is turn on).
  - Out of the box Read Side offset management residing in the Chief-Of-State readSide store (postgresql).
  - Out of the box observability.
  - Out of the box configurable k8 deployment.

# install earth cli
brew install earthly

# locally build the image
earth +docker-build

# run local cluster with docker/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up -d

# observe containers
docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . ps

# shut it down
docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml down -t 0 --remove-orphans
